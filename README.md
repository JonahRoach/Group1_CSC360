# Group 1 Web Applications
Overview of Project

The project being created will allow users the ability to track their fitness goals. Through the use of server side calculations the Users will be able to generate helpful suggestions on how to improve their workouts/eating habits. This will be done by generating max BMI for the User, along with a optimal calorie intake per day (with meal plan examples). If the User ever wishes to change their personal goals or BMI, the application will automatically adjust all necessary calculations for the user to ensure optimal success. The application can also be used to check other user profiles to gain goal ideas and help form a community of people bettering themselves both physically and mentally.
